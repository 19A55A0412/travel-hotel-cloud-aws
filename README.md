# Cloud-Based Travel & Hotel Management System

## MSc Cloud Computing Project – University of East London

This project presents a cloud-based, AI-powered Travel and Hotel Management System designed to improve booking efficiency, enhance customer experience, and provide scalable and secure operations using AWS cloud services. The system leverages serverless architecture and intelligent automation to deliver real-time booking, predictive analytics, and personalized services.

---

## Project Overview
The travel and hospitality industry faces challenges such as manual booking, inefficient operations, and lack of personalization. This solution addresses these problems by implementing a modern cloud architecture using AWS to ensure high availability, security, and scalability.

This system automates booking, manages hotel operations, and provides personalized recommendations using AI and predictive analytics.
